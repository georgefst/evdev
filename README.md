Haskell evdev library
=====================

See Hackage for documentation on [the core library](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/evdev) and [the streamly add-on](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/evdev-streamly).

In addition, the [evdev-examples](https://github.com/georgefst/evdev/tree/master/evdev-examples) directory contains a basic `evtest` clone (with the added ability to read events from multiple devices concurrently), as well as simple programs for replaying event sequences, spawning processes on a trigger event, and creating virtual events from keyboard input.
